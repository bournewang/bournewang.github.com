            <div class='definition'>1. A value kept constant during an experiment, equation, calculation or similar, but
                varied over other versions of the experiment, equation, calculation, etc.
            </div>
            <div class='definition'>2. A variable that describes some system (material, object, event etc.) or some
                aspect thereof
            </div>
            <div class='definition'>3. An input variable of a procedure definition, that gets an actual value (argument)
                at execution time (formal parameter).
            </div>
            <div class='example'>Roughly, a tuple of arguments could be thought of as a vector, whereas a tuple of
                parameters could be thought of as a covector (i.e., linear functional). When a function is called, a
                parameter tuple becomes "bound" to an argument tuple, allowing the function instance itself to be
                computed to yield a return value. This would be roughly analogous to applying a covector to a vector (by
                taking their dot product (or, rather, matrix-product of row vector and column vector)) to obtain a
                scalar.
            </div>
            <div class='definition'>4. An actual value given to such a formal parameter (argument or actual
                parameter).
            </div>
            <div class='definition'>5. A characteristic or feature that distinguishes something from others.</div>
            <div class='definition'>6. In the ellipse and hyperbola, a third proportional to any diameter and its
                conjugate, or in the parabola, to any abscissa and the corresponding ordinate.
            </div>
            <div class='example'>The parameter of the principal axis of a conic section is called the latus rectum.
            </div>
            <div class='definition'>7. The ratio of the three crystallographic axes which determines the position of any
                plane.
            </div>
            <div class='definition'>8. The fundamental axial ratio for a given species.</div>
