            <div class='definition'>1. A group, often named or numbered, to which items are assigned based on similarity
                or defined criteria.

            <div class='example'>I wouldn't put this book in the same category as the author's first novel.</div>
            <div class='definition'>2. A collection of objects, together with a transitively closed collection of
                composable arrows between them, such that every object has an identity arrow, and such that arrow
                composition is associative.
            </div>
            <div class='example'>Just as a monoid consists of an underlying set with a binary operation "on top of it"
                which is closed, associative and with an identity, a category consists of an underlying digraph with an
                arrow composition operation "on top of it" which is transitively closed, associative, and with an
                identity at each object. In fact, a category's composition operation, when restricted to a single one of
                its objects, turns that object's set of arrows (which would all be loops) into a monoid.
