            <div class='definition'>1. Something that overlaps or is overlapped</div>
            <div class='definition'>2. A situation in the game where an attacking line has more players in it than the
                defensive line coming to meet it. The attacking side may exploit the overlap by using their superior
                numbers to break the opposition's defensive line. If attackers outnumber defenders by more than one
                player this is often termed a two man overlap or three man overlap, etc. If the attacking side fails to
                break through usually due to poor execution, they are said to waste an overlap.
