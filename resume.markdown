## Introduction
I have been working in software development and management since I graduated in 2005 with a bachelor's. I have over 10 years of experience in the field of Internet and enterprise application development.

From last year, I started to shift to the direction of bigdata, studying under [**_Mr. Hou Shengwen_**](https://mvp.aliyun.com/mvp/detail/394 ){:target="_blank"}, a famous bigdata expert in China, who was one of the [**MVP of Alibaba**](https://mvp.aliyun.com/mvp/detail/394){:target="_blank"} and [**TVP of Tencent**](https://cloud.tencent.com/tvp/member/462){:target="_blank"} and now is the Chief Technical Expert of Telecom Tianyi Cloud.

I live in Shanghai. Before the pandemic, I enjoy traveling to different places.

I am seeking a job now, and you can contact me through **xiaopei0206@icloud.com** if you are interested in me.
