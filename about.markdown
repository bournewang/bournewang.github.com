Thank you for visiting my blog.

Since graduating from university, I have been working in software development.
In a career spanning nearly twenty years, I have worked as a C/linux software engineer, a full stack web developer, and started a business as a technical partner.
In recent years, I started to shift to the direction of big data, studying under Mr. Hou Shengwen, a famous big data expert in China, who was the MVP of Ali and is now the Chief Technologist of Telecom Tianyi Cloud.

I live in Shanghai. Before the pandemic, I enjoy travelling to different places. 

I'm seeking a job now, you can contact me though: [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}){:target='_blank'}
